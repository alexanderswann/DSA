use code like this - RBTree tree = new RBTree(); - to create a new tree and use add to add numbers to the tree, remove to remove nubmers, and levelOrder to see your tree

tree.levelOrder() prints out our tree in a pretty graphical way
tree.remove(int) removes the specified int from our tree
tree.add(int) adds the specified int to our tree, duplicate ints cannot be added
tree.contains(int) returns true if the specified int is in our tree and false otherwise
